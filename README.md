#  Exploring Data Relationships with EDA: Titanic Dataset Analysis
##  Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival. By cleaning the data and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we uncover patterns and trends related to age, gender, ticket class, and more.

##  Problem Statement
The Titanic disaster led to significant loss of life. This project explores historical passenger data to identify which factors most impacted survival rates, such as demographic and ticket-related information.

---

##  Objective
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant features in the dataset.
- Perform EDA to visualize survival rates across variables like age, gender, class, and family size.
- Identify key features that influenced passenger survival.

---

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Results
- Females had a significantly higher chance of survival than males.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive than second or third-class passengers.
- Children under age 10 had higher survival rates.
- Passengers from larger families tended to have lower survival rates.

---

##  Conclusion
The project successfully cleaned and analyzed the Titanic dataset. EDA revealed that features such as gender, age, and class played a crucial role in survival. These insights help in building predictive models and understanding historical events better.
